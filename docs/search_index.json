there, if you want to learn how to use Pixpipe, you're at the right place! This cookbook was made to cover the majority of use-cases and provide enough material to get you started, though it does not cover 100% of Pixpipe. If you have a question or would like to see an additional section in this book, please raise an issue on the cookbook's repo.\nInstall for production\nnpm install --save pixpipe\n\nThe file that will then be imported is dist/pixpipe.js. It is a umd bundle, meaning it's ugly but it's compatible everywhere: Node, Browsers and ES modules. Still, Pixpipe won't work on old browsers (i.e. the one that don't support typed arrays).\nIn HTML file\n\n\n\n\nIn Node\nconst pixpipe = require(\"pixpipe\");\n\nIn ES module\nimport pixpipe from 'pixpipe';\n\n\nif ('UA-110948661-1') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-110948661-1', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"1-overview/0-README.html":{"url":"1-overview/0-README.html","title":"Pixpipe Overview","keywords":"","body":"Pixpipe Overview\nThe point of Pixpipe is to be easy to use and easy to contribute to.

It was inspired by ITK for its genericity because it makes the pipeline scalable and modular.\nEverything you can find in src/core is the core. Easy. Let's see how it looks like:\n\nAs you can see, the core elements can be described like this: containers on one side and processors on the other.\nGeneric Interfaces\nPixpipeObject\ngeneric interfaceThe most generic! You cannot do anything with it except extending it and every object in Pixpipe is (and must be) a PixpipeObject.PixpipeObjectis an interface, it implements the following features:  \n\nUUID: a unique identifier for each and every object created in the pipeline. Since it is not practical to access memory addresses in Javascript, this is very useful for debugging your program and make sure that \"This is the deep copy of an object rather than a pointer to the same address\".\nMetadata: every description, setting or relevant piece of information must be stored in metadata, all the methods to create/read/modify are here. Don't put large arrays of data here, and don't put TypedArrays as it does not play well with serialization (see: pixp format).\nType: every object must have a type descriptor (String). It can be there own or the type of their mother class. For example Image3D has the type \"IMAGE3D\" and MniVolume does not overwrite it, hence, it also has the type descriptor \"IMAGE3D\". This is mainly used to ensure compatibility between data containers.Read more.\n\nPixpipeContainer\ncontainer interfaceSo far, a PixpipeObject is still not containing any data, only a few metadata. To fix that and create a proper container able to store a large amount of data, PixpipeContainer introduces a new attribute: _data.Initialize to null, we profit from Javascript's dynamic typing ability to make it store whatever we want.For the sake of easily creating a specialized object from a pixp file, this interface also implements setRawMetadata() and setRawMetadata() but don't use them too much since there is absolutely no control, just raw object pointer attribution.\nThis is still an interface and even though you could probably use it as-is, this is not the point.Read more.\nPixpipeContainerMultiData\ncontainer interfaceA PixpipeContainerMultiData object does not exist as is, this is an interface to data-structures which need to encode multiple numerical buffers, possibly of different types, each of them having a name (or ID, as you prefer to call it).For example, say you need a data-structure that needs 1D measurement (like a Signal1D) but also need to associate an integer for each of these measurement (for example a class, if you want to make clusters), then you will most likely need a Float32Array for measurement and a Uint8Array for classifing. A type that inherits PixpipeContainerMultiData will serve this purpose and all the methods that are already there will help you save time.Read more.\nFilter\nprocessor interfaceA Filter's job is to process an input data in a non-destructive way and output another data. Filter is an interface, it cannot be used as-is, and you'll need to extend it to implement your own filter.Filters' input can be of any type or Object (Image2D, Image3D, ArrayBuffer, JSON, etc.) and must always be set using the method .addInput( Object, category) where Object is the input object itself and category is a Number or a String that will be used as an internal identifier. Most of the time it is convenient to use an incremental integer as a category but if your needs only one input, the argument category is optional and the category 0 will be given.Launching a filter is mandatory in order to get any output, this is done by calling the method .update(). Though, you will have to implement the method ._run() (no argument) and possibly some other internal private method to help _run to do the job.When .update() is done, a filter is ready to give some output, using the method .getOutput(category), when category is an optional identifier (default: 0).  \nIf you happen to create your own custom filter, always add some input verification before doing any real job using inputs. This is better than throwing exceptions away and breaking the pipeline.Read more.\nImageToImageFilter\nprocessor interfaceThis extends Filter but still does not process anything. This is again an interface for any custom filter that would input one or multiple Image2D and output one Image2D (actually, this is not strictly required, it could output anything else, like statistics for examples).ImageToImageFilter provides a method to check if all the input Image2D have the same size: .hasSameSizeInput() and if they have the same number of components per pixel: .hasSameNcppInput(). These two methods should be called at the beginning of the ._run() method, but if your custom filter happens not to need these verifications, then simply don't call them.Read more.\nSpecialized Objects\nImage2D\ncontainerOne of the most important containers, it is made to store 2D image datasets, for example coming from a jpeg** image.This class contains everything needed to initialize, get and set pixel values.The information of width, height and ncpp (number of components per pixel, 3 for RGB, 4 for RGBA) are all stored into metadata but they can all be fetched using dedicated getters.In term of dimensionality, Image2D pixels are stored row-wise* in a 1D TypedArray: the whole line1 RGBARGBA followed by the second line2, etc.Read more.\nImage3D\ncontainer - soon to be deprecatedThe equivalent of Image2D for 3d datasets. Unlike 2D datasets, 3D ones have a parametric dimensionality order. By default, the largest dimensionality is along xspace and the smallest is along zspace. Since all dimensionality information are stored in metadata, the order can be changed, especially when initializing the Image3D with setData() with the appropriate options.Image3D have the built-in  ability to export Image2D object of slices (at a given position along a given axis) without using an external filter.Read more.\nMniVolume\ncontainerThis object is motivated by the medical dataset used internally in the Montreal Neurological Institute: NIfTI, Minc2 and MGH/MGZ. They are respectively created by NiftiDecoder and Minc2Decoder. Keep in mind MniVolumes are Image3D and uses the same methods.Read more.\nImage3DAlt\ncontainerThis container is also for volume data, handles everything from MniVolume but with better metadata and affine transformations.Read more.\nSignal1D\ncontainer - soon to be deprecatedLike Image2D stores a 2D signal, the Signal1D is intended to store single dimensional signals, for example intensities of an EEG. There are special filters associated with this container, for example to perform Fourier Transform.Read more.\nLineString\ncontainerA LineString is a vectorial representation of a polyline in a space of a given number of dimensions. In 2D by default, this can be changed using the method .setNod(Number) to 3D or even more, as long as it makes sense for the application. A line string can be closed whn calling the method .close() so that it becomes a polygon. Points can be added (to the end) or popped (from the end).The internal data structure of a LineString is a Float32Array and If a line string lays in a 2D, the internal data will be represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ...]. This is very convenient when it comes to encode or compresse the data (e.g. for storing in a file) but the user should not have to deal directly with this structure and should use the dedicated methods to interact with a LineString.Read more.\nMesh3D\ncontainerThe Mesh3D class is a good example of usage of PixpipeContainerMultiData. An instance of Mesh3D represents a mesh, in 3D, aka a surface. To serve this purpose, it stores four types of data:\n\nthe vertex positions, as an array of [x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, ...] (Float32Array)\nthe list of each each vertex index grouped by 3 (if faces are triangles) such as [Va0, Va1, Va2, Vb0, Vb1, Vb2, ...] where a is the first triangle, b is the second...  (Uint32Array)\nthe polygons/triangles' normal vectors [x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, ...]. Even though those could be computed with a cross product using a right hand rule, it can be convenient the list them in case all the faces don't follow this rule. (Float32Array)\nthe vertex colors as a list of RGBa such as [V0R, V0G, V0G, V0a, V1R, V1G, V1B, V1a, ...] (Uint8Array)\nEach of these structure can be set from dedicated methods and you should not have to deal with low level private arrays.Read more.\n\nDecoders\nAs we have seen earlier, Filter take inputs, perform a task and give outputs. Most of the time, processing data means there is a preliminary step of getting these data from existing files. Reading a file, decoding, is a task that can be performed in Pixpipe, directly in the browser with Javascript. Before going further on how to access a file buffer and how to create a Image2D out of a Jpeg file, we need to be clear on the existing pieces to use to do it, so that we don't reinvent the wheel.  \nNotice: What we call Data Decoder does not match to any class name in Pixpipe, it is just a general term used for the sake of this explanation and the same goes for Generic Decoders.\nHere, we are taking the example of TiffDecoder. As its name implies, it takes the ArrayBuffer of a Tiff file in input and outputs an Image2D.The class TiffDecoder is a special kind of Filter because it inherits from the interface Decoder (and Decoder inherit from Filter). This interface adds the logic responsible for dealing with inputs of different kinds; by default of a binary format, but some files are text-based. Other than that, a Decoder is just like a Filter.Since we don't want to reinvent the wheel, we don't want to reimplement a Tiff parser if a good one is already out there, this is why the last link of the chain, TiffDecoder, has a dependency to the Geotiff library.\nAs a separate matter and in order to simplify the usage of Pixpipe to other developers, we decided it would be nice to have a decoder that handles different kinds of files without having to specify if it's a PNG, a Jpeg or a Tiff. In the end, this decoder would just output an Image2D. This it what we call Generic Decoders.Those ones work a bit like regular decoder but instead of relying on external libraries to do the job, they rely on decoders that already exist in Pixpipe. When the update() method is called, these generic decoders will successively attempt to decode the buffer with each decoders specified in the list (this._decoders) until it succeed.\n\n\n\nif ('UA-110948661-1') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-110948661-1', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"3-build-pixpipe/0-README.html":{"url":"3-build-pixpipe/0-README.html","title":"Building Pixpipe","keywords":"","body":"Building Pixpipe\nBy default, Pixpipe already comes with a built version in the dist directory.

It is important to understand how to use Pixpipe before trying to develop your own filters in order to respect the coherence that makes it easy to use.You can run and explore the source of all the examples, they are simple HTML pages and links are all provided.\nBefore starting, remember these two things:\n\nFilters take one or more input using the method addInput(), must be ran using update() and produce one or more output that can be accessed with getOutput()\nWhen a filter takes multiple inputs, the method addInput() takes an additional argument to identify it. Read the code documentation to find out what are the categories of the expected inputs.\nThe method getOutput() has the same feature. If multiple are expected, the method will take an argument (string) that is the category of the output. Though you can alway use the method .forEachOutput(...) - doc\nWhen it comes to containers' metadata (particular setting, overwriting a default algorithm value, etc.), the filter method .setMetadata(...) must be called.\nA Filter should NEVER modify the input data and it's the duty of the developer to respect that.  \n\n// the object myImage comes from a file that you previously opened\n\nvar myFilter = new pixpipe.AmazingFilter();\n\n// Some filter have specific setting, if so, they have default values but you can still change them:\nmyFilter.setMetadata( \"someSetting\", 42 );\nmyFilter.setMetadata( \"someOtherSetting\", \"gaussian\" );\n\n// If the filter is supposed to take a single input, this is enough:\nmyFilter.addInput( myImage );\n// and this is exactly the same as doing\nmyFilter.addInput( myImage, 0 );\n\n// But is the filter expect multiple inputs, we have to specify the \"category\" of each:\nmyFilter.addInput( myImage, \"principalImage\" );\nmyFilter.addInput( myImage2, \"secondaryImage\" );\n\n// run the filter\nmyFilter.update();\n\n// Get the output from the filter.

For example, your custom filter can inherit from the class/interface ImageToImageFilter, which has the advantage of having some Image2D checking methods already built-in.\nThe class ImageToImageFilter itself inherits from Filter and we could imagine creating other interface filters that carry some specific logic but no actual data processing.\nWhat are inputs and outputs?\nInput and output data can be of different types but are usually PixpipeContainer. They are stored in a Filter's attribute under the name this._input and this._output. These two objects are actually maps and need a category.\nA category is just a way to give an identifier when adding an input (externally) or an output (internally, to create it). If your filter needs only a single input, adding a category is optional (\"0\" will be given). Same thing for the output, if your filter creates only one, then it's category should be \"0\" because the method .getOutput() uses a default value \"0\" for the category argument. The concept of category becomes very convenient when your filter has to manage multiple I/O.\nFrom the outside of your custom filter, here are the methods you can use that are already part of the Filter class:\n// Create a instance of your custom filter\nvar myFilter = new pixpipe.MyCustomFilterType();\n\n// we have only one input, no need to specify a category\nmyFilter.addInput( myImage2D );\n\n// if we have more than one input, we identify them with a \"category\"\nmyFilter.addInput( myImage2D_1, 0);\nmyFilter.addInput( myImage2D_2, 1);\n\n// Note that the category can also be a String\nmyFilter.addInput( myImage2D_1, \"image_one\");\nmyFilter.addInput( myImage2D_2, \"image_two\");\n...\n\n// run the filter\nmyFilter.update()\n...\n\n// If your filter has a single output, no need to\nvar myOutput = myFilter.getOutput();\n\n// If your filter has more than one output\nvar myFirstOutput = myFilter.getOutput(0);\nvar myFirstOutput = myFilter.getOutput(1);\n\n// Note that the category can also be a String\nvar myFirstOutput = myFilter.getOutput(\"the_noise_image\");\nvar myFirstOutput = myFilter.getOutput(\"the_signal_image\");\n\n// get the number of input categories (already given)\nvar numOfInputs = myFilter.getNumberOfInputs();\n\n// get the number of output categories\nvar numOfOutputs = myFilter.getNumberOfOutputs();\n\n// You can also batch process the outputs\nmyFilter.forEachOutput( function( category, outputObject ){\n  // do something\n});\n\n// to know if a filter has an output of a given category\nif( myFilter.hasInputOfCategory(\"the_signal_image\") ){\n  // do something\n}\n\n// get the list of all input categories given to the filter\nvar allInputCat = myFilter.getInputCategories();\n\n// get the list of all output categories given to the filter\nvar allOutputCat = myFilter.getOutputCategories();\n\n// tells if after calling update() there is at least one output created\nvar isReady = myFilter.hasOutputReady();\n\nFrom the inside of your filter, there are a few other (supposedly private) I/O-related methods:\n// get an input when we know we have only one\nvar theInput = this._getInput();\n\n// get an input of a given category\nvar theInput = this._getInput(\"image_one\");\n\n// batch process the inputs, when we have many of them\nthis._forEachInput( function(category, inputObject){\n  // do something with each input\n})\n\n// add a new output of a given type that encapsulate the category checking\nthis._addOutput( Image2D );\n\n// the same but with a given category\nthis._addOutput( Image2D, \"the_first_output\" );\n\n// then retrieve the blank output\nvar outputImg = this.getOutput();\n\n// and initialize it with real values\noutputImg.setData(\n  bufferCopy,\n  inputImage2D.getWidth(),\n  inputImage2D.getHeight(),\n  inputImage2D.getComponentsPerPixel()\n);\n\nWhat are metadata?\nA filter can also accept any kind of metadata so that it can do its job properly. The can be used to store the settings of an algorithm, default values, etc. They can be accessed from the outside as well as from the inside.In the case of a filter that performs an algorithm, all the settings must be stored as metadata and we strongly discourage to use class attributes for that (see serialization). As shown on the diagram, the metadata logic is hosted by the interface called PixpipeObject. The class Filter and every other object that belong to the Pixpipe project inherit from PixpipeObject.\nHere are the metadata-related methods you can use from the outside:\n// Create a instance of your custom filter\nvar myFilter = new pixpipe.MyCustomFilterType();\n\n// Specify a metadata\nmyFilter.setMetadata(\"threshold\", 100);\n\n// retrieve a metadata\nvar threshold = getMetadata(\"threshold\");\n\n// check the existance of a given metadata\nif( myFilter.hasMetadata( \"threshold\" ) ){\n  // do something\n}\n\n// retrieve all the metadata names already specified\nvar allMetaNames = myFilter.getMetadataKeys();\n\n// Copy all the metadata from another object\nmyFilter.copyMetadataFrom( anotherFilter );\n\nCan I add class attributes?\nYes, like any other class, your custom filter can use attributes to store temporary data, but not for inputs, outputs or metadata of major importance.\nHow to make the filter runnable?\nAs seen earlier, to run a filter, the method .update() should be called, though, the method that should be implemented in every new custom filter is _run().The _run() method is called by update() along with some others (this logic is implemented in the mother class Filter). It should perform the reading of inputs, the processing and the writing of outputs.\nA FILTER SHOULD NEVER ALTER THE INPUT this is an important rule, you must not break it\nKeep in mind\nA filter may need to be compatible with different kind of inputs and it is to the discretion of the developer to develop it properly. For example, a filter that takes an Image2D as input has to deal with a variable number of component per pixel so that it behaves in an expected way with a single-band image (b&w) but also with an RGB or RGBA image.  \nIf a filter can deal only with a certain kind of input, it should be explicitly stated in the documentation.\nRegister your filter\nTo make your custom filter accessible when building Pixpipe, you must register it in the file src/pixpipe.js:  \nexport { MyCustomFilter } from './filter/MyCustomFilter';\n\n\nif ('UA-110948661-1') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-110948661-1', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"5-make-your-own-filter/2-practical-example.html":{"url":"5-make-your-own-filter/2-practical-example.html","title":"Practical example","keywords":"","body":"A Practical example\nIn this section, we will go step by step into a simple example: a filter that performs a simple threshold on an image.You can find this filter in the repo at src/filter/SimpleThresholdFilter.js (source).This filter is simple enough to not have a source cluttered with complicated algorithmic details.Along with the filter, an example of its usage will help you to better understand the logic: examples/imageThresholding.html (source, you can also run this example).\nThe following is a step-by-step explanation of what happens in this filter.\nFirst, the structure\nThe structure is quite basic and very ES6-style.\n// make Image2D and ImageToImageFilter visible from here because we will use them\nimport { Image2D } from '../core/Image2D.js';\nimport { ImageToImageFilter } from '../core/ImageToImageFilter.js';\n\n// Our new class SimpleThresholdFilter extends from the interface ImageToImageFilter\nclass SimpleThresholdFilter extends ImageToImageFilter {\n  constructor(){\n    // ... to be implemented\n  }\n\n  _run(){\n    // ... to be implemented\n  }\n\n} /* END of class SimpleThresholdFilter */\n\n// make SimpleThresholdFilter importable\nexport { SimpleThresholdFilter }\n\nDepending on what your own filter will do, you may want to inherit directly from Filter rather than from ImageToImageFilter. It's up to you and like usually in programming, it's not like there is a single right answer.\nAdding the constructor\nSince we inherit from a class, the first thing to do in the constructor is to call the constructor of the parent class using super():\n// make Image2D and ImageToImageFilter visible from here because we will use them\nimport { Image2D } from '../core/Image2D.js';\nimport { ImageToImageFilter } from '../core/ImageToImageFilter.js';\n\n// Our new class SimpleThresholdFilter extends from the interface ImageToImageFilter\nclass SimpleThresholdFilter extends ImageToImageFilter {\n\n  constructor(){\n    super();\n\n    // default values\n    this.setMetadata(\"threshold\", 128);\n    this.setMetadata(\"lowValue\", 0);\n    this.setMetadata(\"highValue\", 255);\n    this.setMetadata(\"preserveAlpha\", true);\n  }\n\n\n  _run(){\n    // ... to be implemented\n  }\n\n} /* END of class SimpleThresholdFilter */\n\n// make SimpleThresholdFilter importable\nexport { SimpleThresholdFilter }\n\nYou know how a threshold works, right? under a certain value a pixel is set to black and over, it's set to white. But, we have to take in consideration two more things:\n\nOur image may have more than 8bit per pixel (standard [0, 255]) but could be float [0.0, 1.0], 12bit ints [0, 4096], 16bits ints [0, 65535], etc.\nOur image may have 1, or 3 or 4 or more channels. For the sake of simplicity, we will make this filter compatible with single band (intensity), 3 bands (RGB) and 4 bands (RGBA) images.\n\nStill, we want our filter to have built-in default values for the threshold, the value to give when under(lowValue), the value to give when over (highValue) and also if we should preserve the transparency in the case of RGBA images (preserveAlpha).\nThe _run() method\nAll the following takes place in the scope of the _run() method, like here:\n...\n\n_run(){\n  // HERE!\n}\n\n...\n\nRemember _run() is called when you explicitely call update(), and you should not call _run() directly!At this stage, if your filter runs, it means it should already have an input. Let's make sure of it:\n// the input checking\n// the input checking\nif( ! this.hasValidInput())\n  return;\n...\n\nThe method hasValidInput() is a legacy from the class Filter. It checks if a filters input is actually like it should be. Since our filter inherits from ImageToImageFilter, it's constructor (when calling super()) already register that the filter should expect an input of type Image2D and of category \"0\".  \nTo manually add an expected input, just add an entry to the inputValidator by calling the method this.addInputValidator from the constructor (after super()). For example, if our filter was requiring 2 Image2D of category 0 and 1, then we would add that to the constructor:\nthis.addInputValidator(0, Image2D);\nthis.addInputValidator(1, Image2D);\n\nThen, in _run(), calling hasValidInput() in a if statement would make sure our input are actually two Image2D of the given categories.If we have no input, we just quit with a warning message. There is no exception to launch, we just don't have any input, it's not a big deal and we may want to add one later.\nNext, we build some local variables. In Pixpipe, we will often be fetching very large TypedArrays think of it like that: a 1000px by 1000px png (most likely RGBA) is already an array of size 4 million! And nowadays, 1000px by 1000px is not that much so we always have to think about little optimizations because, on a large scale, they will matter a lot.So, why local variables? Simply because in Javascript they are faster to fetch than complex objects. Here is how:\n...\n\nvar inputImg = this._getInput( 0 );\n\n// Number of bands\nvar ncpp = inputImg.getComponentsPerPixel();\n\n// having a local value is faster than fetching an object\nvar threshold = this.getMetadata(\"threshold\");\nvar lowValue = this.getMetadata(\"lowValue\");\nvar highValue = this.getMetadata(\"highValue\");\n\n...\n\nThen we will start to create the content of our output image, but not the Image2D object yet. First we copy the data array of the input image - copy in the sense of duplicate (and not copy of reference):\n...\n\n// get a copy of the input buffer so that we dont overwrite it!\nvar outputBuffer = inputImg.getDataCopy();\n\n...\n\nIf we wanted to get a reference to the original data array of the input image, we would have used inputImg.getData() instead of inputImg.getDataCopy(). Then modifying the array would change the content of the input image and we don't want that.\nNow, we are dealing with checking the number of components per pixel, remember, we want this filter to accept only 1, 3 and 4 components images:\n...\n\n// if the input image has:\n// - a single band, OR\n// - three bands (assuming RGB), OR\n// - four bands (assuming RGBA)\nif(ncpp == 1 || ncpp == 3 || ncpp == 4){\n\n  // later, a few things will go here\n\n}else{\n  outputBuffer = null;\n  console.warn(\"The input data must have 1, 3 or 4 components per pixel.\");\n  return;\n}\n\n...\n\nAs you can see, if the number of components per pixel (aka. ncpp or as previously said channels) is not like we want, we just quit the function before having mapped any output. Still, we want to rush the garbage collector and remain with a potentially large array copied in memory, so we call outputBuffer = null;. Though this is not mandatory and the garbage collector will come anyway.\nThen, let's fill this if:\n...\nif(ncpp == 1 || ncpp == 3 || ncpp == 4){\n\n\n  /**************** PART 1 *********************************************/\n\n  // we want to preserve transparency ( = not affected by thresholding)\n  if( this.getMetadata(\"preserveAlpha\") && ncpp == 4){\n\n  /**************** PART 1.1 *********************************************/\n    for(var i=0; i\nFor the sake of readability, the content was split into different parts.\nPart 1 is about filling the output array based on its own content. In Part 1.1 we do care about the alpha channel when we have 4 components, which consists in skipping every 4 channel. In Part 1.2, we don't care of what channel we are processing, we threshold them all.  \nPart 2 is about creating the output Image2D. In Part 2.1, we can consider _addOutput as a sort of factory that will create a constructed but blank instance of Image2D and will automatically map it to an output of this filter. We could have given this output a specific category by adding another argument: this._addOutput( Image2D, \"myOutputCategory\" );. Since we call it without any category argument, the default will be \"0\".Part 2.2 is about associating the typed array we just modified in the loop to the freshly created output image. For that, we give the array, but also the size and the number of components per pixel.\nThen, don't forget to register your filter so that you can actually use it!\nCould we do it another way?\nSure, in many other ways. A simple alternative would have been to:\nMake a clone of the input image:\n...\nvar inputImg = this._getInput( 0 );\nvar outputImage = inputImg.clone();\nvar outputBuffer = outputImage.getData();\n...\n\nProcess outputBuffer the very same way, and in the end, creating mapping manually outputImage as an output with explicitly giving the category (\"0\" in this case):\n...\nthis._output[0] = outputImage;\n...\n\nAnd that's all, no need to call this._addOutput or outputImg.setData because since outputImg is a clone, it already carries the information about size and number of components.\nThis method is actually faster and potentially even easier to understand. The only disadvantage is that it lets the developer dealing with the output category, which might be a source of error when running the filter.\n\nif ('UA-110948661-1') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-110948661-1', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"5-make-your-own-filter/3-going-further.html":{"url":"5-make-your-own-filter/3-going-further.html","title":"Going Further","keywords":"","body":"Events in filters\nThe class/interface Filter has a built-in event manager so that you can specify callbacks for specific events from the outside. In Javascript, the most common example is in the context of asynchronous processes, like AJAX requests, or with device interaction like mouse/keyboard events.\nFor example, in the class FileImageReader, the _run() method triggers the custom event ready when the desired image is loaded. Just like that:\n...\nimg.onload = function(){\n\n  // in the \"onload\" method, the image is already loaded\n  // but we still have to convert it into an Image2D\n  ...\n\n  // the \"ready\" can now be called\n  that.triggerEvent(\"ready\");\n}\n...\n\nFrom the outside (see examples/urlToImage2D.html) the user must define the callback relative to the ready event. Most of the time, it will be an anonymous function, just like that:\n// The filter to read image from URL\nvar url2ImgFilter = new pixpipe.UrlImageReader();\n\n// the input of this reader is a simple string url. Can be local of distant, but if distant, the server must allow CORS.\nurl2ImgFilter.addInput( \"images/sd.jpg\" );\n\n// the image is loaded...\n// here, this = url2ImgFilter\nurl2ImgFilter.on(\"ready\", function(){\n  // get the output image\n  myImage = this.getOutput();\n\n  ...\n})\n\n// Ask to fetch the image from URL\nurl2ImgFilter.update();\n\nIn an asynchronous context like this one, it does not really matter if we update the filter before or after having defined the ready event. In the time necessary to load the data, the main thread will continue and will have plenty of time to define the events declared just after.On the contrary, in a synchronous context, update should always be called after having defined all the event of this filter.\nLet's take another example: examples/forEachPixel.html. This short test loads local images and calls an anonymous function on each and every pixel of it using the filter ForEachPixelImageFilter.Let's see what happens:\n...\n// first event, the file is finally loaded\nurl2ImgFilter.on( \"ready\", function(){\n\n  // this filter needs a `pixel` event, a function to be applied on each pixel\n  var forEachPixelFilter = new pixpipe.ForEachPixelImageFilter();\n\n  // add the input input\n  forEachPixelFilter.addInput( this.getOutput() );\n\n  // Apply this treatment to each pixel of the image.\n  // args:\n  //   position: 2D position of current pixel as an Object {x, y}\n  //   color: array of colors of the current pixel.\n  //\n  // Must return, or null to not modify the current color,\n  // or an array of the same size of color.\n  forEachPixelFilter.on( \"pixel\", function(position, color){\n    return [\n      color[1], // red (takes the values from green)\n      color[0], // green (takes the values from red)\n      color[2] * 0.5, // blue get 50% darker\n      255 // alpha, at max\n    ]\n  });\n\n  // run the filter\n  forEachPixelFilter.update();\n\n  ...\n});\n\nOnce we are inside the ready event's callback, there is nothing asynchronous anymore, and update() will call _run() that will call the pixel event on each pixel of the image. This means the pixel event must be defined before calling update().\nEvents methods available\nAs seen on the previous part, when using a filter (from the outside), an event should be defined using the method .on(...) as follow:\nmyFilter.on( 'myEventName', function( /* possibly some args */ ){\n  ...\n\n  // returning is not mandatory\n  return 20;\n});\n\nDepending on how you call it from your filter, you may or may not have arguments.The same goes with returned values, if your custom event internally is expected to return something, so be it (see the previous part, with the pixel event).Keep in mind that it's not because you define an event with .on(...) that it will necessary be called, your filter needs to explicitly call it at some point.\nInternally, triggering an event is fairly simple. Here is an example with no arguments and no returned values:\n// here, this is a filter, from the inside\nthis.triggerEvent(\"ready\");\n\nThe case of ForEachPixelImageFilter is a bit more complete since it triggers the event pixel with few arguments and handles a returned value:\nvar newColor = this.triggerEvent(\"pixel\", position2D, currentColor);\n\nAs shown, if an event needs to be triggered with some arguments, just put them after the name of the event itself.  About the returned value, the one of your callback function is just relayed by the method triggerEvent.\nIf you happen to trigger an event that was not defined (using triggerEvent), a warning will be printed in the console but no exception is raised.In addition to triggerEvent, the Filter class comes with hasEvent so that you can check in advance the existance of an event:\n// internally from a custom filter\nif( this.hasEvent(\"dataProcessed\") ){\n  this.triggerEvent( \"dataProcessed\" );\n}else{\n  // do something else, maybe call a default built-in event...\n}\n\nMeasuring time\nThe class/interface PixpipeObject has a built-in system to measure time that any other Pixpipe object can use. It can be useful to track performance and know where to look for further optimization. Here is how to use it, internally from your custom filter:\n...\nthis.addTimeRecord('step1');\n// do things ...\nthis.addTimeRecord('step2');\n// do things ...\nthis.addTimeRecord('step3');\n\nthis.getTime('step2', 'step3', true);\nvar t = this.getTime('step1', 'step3');\n\nconsole.log(\"The whole thing took \" + t + \" millisec.\");\n...\n\nThe method .addTimeRecord creates a new entry and the method .getTime returns the time elapsed from a step (arg 1) to another (arg 2) in milliseconds. In addition to return, it can also print in the JS console when a third argument is set to true.\nVarious optimizations\nAs said the step-by-step part, processing an image means processing very large typed arrays, and saving a single millisecond per pixel really matters!\nFor some algorithm, you may need to use information from metadata extensively (ie. in a loop). If such metadata is initialized in the constructor or above in your code, using it like that:\nthis._metadata.width\n\nis faster than that:\nthis._metadata[\"width\"]\n\nwhich is faster than that:\nthis.getMetadata(\"width\")\n\nUsing the getter is nice because it provides a layer of control and returns null if the metadata does not exist but it's slower, so as long as you are using a metadata internally (from this) and that you know what you are doing (you are sure this metadata actually exists), then it's ok to call it like a regular attributes, with the dot operator.\n\nif ('UA-110948661-1') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-110948661-1', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"GLOSSARY.html":{"url":"GLOSSARY.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"PixpipeObject\nPixpipeObject is the common interface to every object in Pixpipe.

Metadata can be anything except large typed arrays. They are sometimes used to store  informations that are not essential (description, date, etc.), but they can also store data that are mandatory to use the container properly (width, height, affine transformations, etc.).Metadata are usually considered public because they can be accessed from the outside using the method .getMetadata(string).\nSerialization\nThe serialization is the process to turn a data container (PixpipeContainer) into a file. This file can then be read by Pixpipe to be \"de-serialized\" and produce a PixpipeContainer similar to the original. The serialization handles only the attributes _data and _metadata, for this reason it is unsafe to store information in other attributes. They would be lost in the serialization process.\nBVH\nBounding Volume Hierarchy. Commonly used in video games to perform hit tests in real time between triangles and rays, a BVH is a way to arrange the triangles as a binary tree to perform fast lookups. As a comparison, octrees are usually used for sigle points spatial lookup while BVH is for shapes (triangles or more complex)\nDecoder\nA decoder is a piece of code that is able to parse a file and extract some data, such as an Image2D or any other container.
